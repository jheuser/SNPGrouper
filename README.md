Program to identify unique mutations for given metadata groups from a given VCF and metadata table

Using a Grouped VCF and a Tag file where the metadata is listed in order of individuals in the VCF

Right now the program is missing the set up for the VCF file so that the program will most likely not work without it
unforunatly that addition to here is delayed due to a computing cluster shutdown and will not be avaliable until August 10th
